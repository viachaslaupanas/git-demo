sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on this their chosen battle field

form the lines
shield by shield
side by side
we're marching into destiny

Hello, is there're anyabody in there
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there're anyone at home

Can you stand up
I do believe it's wokring good
That'll keep you going through the show
Common it's time to go

David Gilmour
