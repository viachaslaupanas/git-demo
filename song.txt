sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on this their chosen battle field

form the lines
shield by shield
side by side
we're marching into destiny

Hello, is there're anyabody in there
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there're anyone at home

Ok, just a litle говно
There'll be no more
But you can feel a litle sick

Ok, just a litle хуй
There'll be no more
But you can feel a litle sick

David Gilmour
